"""Common matplotlib style for the figures of the DynamicPlans papers.

This file is a COPY of Styles/figstyle.py, installed into each paper so that its code directory
is self-contained and can be published on its own. Edit the master and run Styles/sync_styles.sh
to install it again, or edit this copy and accept that the paper has deliberately diverged;
sync_styles.sh reports which papers have.

Colour. All text is black and grey is for furniture only, so that nothing a reader must read is
set in grey. INK carries text and data, INK2 the axis frame, reference lines and streamlines, and
GRID the grid. BLUE, ORANGE and AQUA are the three categorical slots, and a colour means the same
thing in every figure of a paper.

A paper that needs a colour outside this set defines it in its own copy, beside this palette, with
a comment saying what it is for.

# The backend must be chosen before pyplot is imported, so this module has to be imported before
# it. Importing it afterwards would leave the figure on the backend pyplot had already chosen and
# the paper would get a figure that looks subtly wrong rather than an error. That is exactly how
# thirty-five scripts in this project came to set their own backend and bypass this file for
# months, so the condition is checked rather than trusted.

# The figures are typeset by LaTeX itself, through matplotlib's pgf backend, rather than by
# matplotlib's own mathtext. Mathtext is a reimplementation of TeX's maths layout and only
# approximates it: superscripts come out at the wrong optical size and the space around relations
# and around Greek letters is not TeX's. And `font.family='serif'` does not mean the document's
# serif: it means matplotlib's fallback, DejaVu Serif, which would set a figure's prose in one
# typeface and its mathematics in another, neither of them the paper's. Handing the labels to
# LaTeX removes all three problems at once, and the figures then inherit the typeface the document
# sets, so a later change of font needs no change here.
#
# pdflatex rather than lualatex: the paper is built with lualatex and loads fontspec through
# dynamicplans.sty, which selects Latin Modern, the OpenType form of Computer Modern that pdflatex
# gives here, so the two match on the page. pdflatex needs no luaotfload and therefore runs on any
# machine a replicator might use. Change this one line if the paper ever moves to another font.

# The size scale. One number sets everything, and the ratios between the sizes are fixed here rather
# than in each script, so the hierarchy is guaranteed: a panel title is the largest text in a figure,
# an axis label is next, tick labels and legends sit below that, and text placed inside the axes is
# the smallest, because it shares the space with the curves.
#
# A script must not write a bare number for a size. matplotlib applies `axes.titlesize` only when
# `set_title` is called WITHOUT `fontsize=`, and it has no rcParam at all for `annotate`, whose text
# falls back to `font.size`. A literal in either place is invisible to this file, and changing BASE
# then appears to do nothing: that is exactly how the panel titles came to be pinned at 8 while the
# axis labels moved to 10, which is the wrong way round.

# mistaken for one another, so a head adds ink without adding information. Felicity drew its leaders
# this way all along.

# MOTION is an arrowhead ON a path, saying which way the path runs. There the head IS the
# information, so it keeps one. Two things matter in how it is drawn. It takes `lw=0`, so that only
# the head appears and the path keeps its own weight and colour: an arrow drawn as a separate
# segment over a line appears as a second line of a different weight, which is what made the
# direction arrows in Health's phase diagram sit badly on the axis they belonged to. And
# `mutation_scale=1` makes head_length and head_width plain points, matched to the Stealth tips the
# TikZ figures use, so the two kinds of figure draw the same arrowhead. The colour is the caller's:
# an arrowhead on a curve takes that curve's colour.
MOTION = dict(arrowstyle='-|>, head_length=3.6, head_width=1.5', lw=0, mutation_scale=1)

# Ordered families are not categories, so they do not take a slot above. A series whose index is a
# magnitude rather than an identity is coloured along this ramp, light to dark, so that the reader
# reads the order off the figure instead of a legend.
